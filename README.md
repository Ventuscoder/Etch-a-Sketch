# etch-a-sketch
This is a simple drawing canvas, for which the logic was made using JavaScript.
I have tried to keep the code as simple as possible so that others can understand it.

Main features:
1. Coloring on a canvas
2. Customizing size of canvas
3. Shading on canvas
4. Random colors to draw with on canvas
5. Erasing
